# OUTLINE

## ✈️ Overview

- Beginner basics (variables, if/else, loops, functions), Naming conventions
- Datastructures (list, dict, tuple, sets, iteration techniques, nested variants)
- Map, Reduce, Filter, Comprehension
- Classes (Basics, Inheritance, Static methods, dunder)
- Type Hints
- String manipulation
- Standard library
  - CSV, JSON
  - Date(Time)
  - Random
  - File access
- Exceptions
- Modules (Structure e.g. **init**, pip(env))

Bonus + Nice to have:

- Generator, Iterators (`itertools`)
- Decorator, First-class functions
- Async/await
- Multiprocessing
- Idiomatic python (documentation, annotation, unittesting)
- Debugging strategies (e.g. debugger)
- Implement a project (see following ideas)

Project ideas:

- spotify evaluator
- telegram bot to scrape mensa meals
- [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver
- 2048 terminal game (hard on windows)
