# Phone üì±
# The class phone gets initialized with 1 number.
# You can call the 1 number, but only if it's valid.
# Write a method that validates the number: Valid if starts with a 0 otherwise not.

# Also, you don't want to get disturbed while eating ice cream, so you can turn on don't disturb mode.
# The method "ring" only rings your phone if do not disturb is off. You should be able to turn not disturb mode on and off
