### üêü Lanternfish

> This is game is from [Advent of Code 2021 Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)

We are diving in the ocean when we notice a swarm of Lanterfishes. After observing a while you notice that every 7 days a Lanternfish reproduces and creates a new Lanterfish. The Lanternfish needs 2 days before it can start creating children.

We can assume that every Lanternfish has an internal clock that counts down 1 each day.

**Rules**

- When the counter reaches 0, it resets to 6 and creates a new Lanternfish with an internal counter of 8
- Otherwise, just count down by 1

Now we want to track a swarm of Lanternfishes. To do so we have a list of fish with their internal clocks.

**Example**

Starting with 5 Lanternfishes with an internal clock of 3, 4, 3, 1 and 2.
After 10 days the swarm counts 12 fish.

```
Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2
After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
```

How big is the swarm after 80 days?

There are a few more things we would like to check here:

- Does it make a difference if you reverse the fish at the beginning? Check it üëçüèª
- How does the number of fish after 80 days changes, when you remove the first of the initial fish?
- Each fish should have a unique internal clock, so remove the duplicates. How does the number change?

Bonus: How big is the swarm after 256 days? (Your solution should not take more than a second)
