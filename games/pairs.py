# All the students must get together in groups.
# Are all students in a group or is there someone alone?

# 1. Define a variable "students" and one "group_size"
# 2. Check with the modulo operator "%" if there is someone left out if the gruop

# Bonus Points: What group sizes are possible so that no one is left out?
